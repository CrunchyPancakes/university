          <h2>Manraj Rahi - Current Student</h2>
          <p>
            What attracted me to studying IS was the belief that this major
            provides a future-focused education and an understanding of business
            and the commercial world. I also felt it would complement my law
            degree with a unique set of skills through a different learning
            area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choosing my favourite paper is tricky. INFO141 was the paper where I
            felt I gained an appreciation of what a Business Analyst would do
            and the practical skills required - I found this really valuable. In
            general, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the practical elements of the
            program; actually being given a chance to apply the skills you learn
            in lectures meant the INFO degree has lived up to - and exceeded -
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My advice to prospective students would be: Make the most of it!
            Fully engage in your workshops and tutorials and all of the
            opportunities INFO gives you, to connect your degree to the real
            world.

          <h2>Patrick Miller - Graduate</h2>
          <p>
            INFO101 was when I was first introduced to Information Systems, and
            after completing the website project, which was something completely
            different to any other assignments I had to do in my first year, I
            knew that I wanted to pursue INFO as a major. I decided to study
            INFO for another three years because each course I took was more and
            more varied than the last.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s tough to say what my favourite course would have been - all of
            the 200 level INFO papers were amazing. INFO226 holds a special
            place in my heart because after studying it, I came back to tutor it
            the following year. It’s one of those courses that you get out what
            you put in. If you enjoy complex problem solving and the thrill of
            finally getting something to work after trying and trying, then this
            is the course for you. Extremely rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            My advice to prospective students would be: Do it. 100% do it. You
            will never regret the decision to study INFO. The lecturers and
            support staff are really lovely and helpful, most importantly the
            content is relevant and gives you a good understanding to grow from
            in whatever career you end up pursuing.

          <h2>Claudia Sullivan - Current Student</h2>
          <p>
            I’m from Christchurch initially, but I love Wellington! It’s a fun
            and vibrant city that has the perfect balance between student and
            corporate life, After having looked into the business schools around
            the country, I decided Victoria offered a degree and a culture which
            aligned most with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, I had intentions to complete my degree with a Marketing
            and Management major, but since taking INFO101, I decided that
            Information Systems was better suited to me. Every paper since has
            solidified that interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            My advice to prospective students would be: Don’t knock it ‘til you
            try it! Even if you don’t love INFO101 like I loved it, the 200 and
            300-level papers is when your INFO degree becomes an exciting and
            interesting journey.
